The many permutations of these modules, also make it hard to decide what to use and how to configure them properly. In most cases this is not well documented, nor are the best practices easy to find, and hence seldom followed. This results in unsafe, buggy, and slow systems not worthy of what one expects of any enterprise application, blockchain none-withstanding!</p> <p>In this session, we will address the challenges of privacy and security by presenting the best patterns and methodologies, of how to implement enterprise grade HLF blockchain implementations.

Our technology consists of two sets of infrastructure. The first is financial contract design patterns that use economic incentives alone to ensure payout, creating a non-recourse system for financial risk transfer. The second is a decentralized data verification mechanism that adds economic guarantees to blockchain oracles.</p> <p>This workshop will teach participants how to build best-in-class financial contracts on Ethereum that can support a wide array of DeFi use cases. Using concepts borrowed from fiat financial derivatives, participants will learn‚Äîwith real, interactive examples‚Äîhow to design and create their own decentralized financial contracts that are self-enforcing, permissionless and universally accessible. The discussion will highlight common pitfalls in building financial products on blockchains, and discuss security and mechanism design concerns. Participants will learn common design patterns to write contracts that can scale to support billions of dollars of economic activity.</p> <p>If you attend this session, you can expect to:<br/>Attain a basic understanding of the #DeFi movement and core concepts behind financial derivatives.<br/>Learn why financial derivatives are different on blockchains (Discussion and demonstration of security vulnerabilities in some existing designs).<br/>Understand common exploits and attack vectors for blockchain based derivatives.<br/>Practice best practices for creating secure synthetic derivatives (Audience can deploy contracts to testnet)</p> <p>To learn more:<br/>DM and/or follow us on Twitter @UMAprotocol<br/>Follow us on Medium<br/>Sign up for early access at www.umaproject.org<br/>Read our whitepaper / check out our GitHub<br/>------------------------<br/>CURRICULUM<br/>------------------------<br/>SEE FULL CURRICULUM HERE:<br/><a ',

Writing a good API is a evolving process.</p> <p>If you are coming to Go from a different language you might be used to using some framework for building REST APIs. Although that seems to increase developer productivity in the beginning, I feel like you loose a lot of visibility and flexibility because of the abstraction. The Go ecosystem favors libraries over frameworks. We will use a library to build our API. Using a library gives us the ability to easily change and modify our API.</p> <p>In this workshop we will take a data set and make an API out of it and learn some of the best practices in making a good API.</p> <p>Attendees can expect to learn:</p> <p>- How a REST API works<br/>- How to make an API<br/>- How to extend an API</p> <p>Pre-requisites</p> <p>- Basic understanding of Go and a Go runtime is useful.<br/>- Install go - <a ',

        '<p>As Java is an object-oriented language that inherently supports the imperative programming style; asynchronicity presents a challenge that can turn one‚Äôs code into a nightmare. One way to deal with the complexity of asynchronicity is to introduce reactivity onto the coding level (reactive functional programming), and/or to handle it on the design and architecture level (reactive systems design).</p> <p>This workshop will introduce you to the principles that drive the movement towards Reactive Systems. We will focus primarily on Reactive Functional Programming, where we will conduct a progressive hands on coding session that will teach you how to start using Java Streams and RxJava and examples of how you might use these techniques in your software applications today.</p> <p>Pre-requisites<br/>Since we will be covering Java you should already be comfortable with running Java, compiling it ( Javac ) And it‚Äôs common build tools like Maven or Gradle</p> <p>While it is not necessary for the attendees to have experience in reactive style of programming, an understanding of and some basic experience on the traditional imperative programming style is highly recommended.</p> <p>Please bring a laptop.</p> <p>Agenda:</p> <p>630pm - doors open, pizza, drinks, &amp; networking<br/>7-815pm - workshop<br/>[masked]pm - Q&amp;A/networking<br/>9pm - doors close</p> <p>Get a head start with IBM Cloud, sign up via: ',

        "<p>It's time for another talk at ny-scala! This time, our speaker is Benjamin Erichsen. Ben's company, William Hill, will host us and serve refreshments at their office in Exchange Place. As usual, doors will open at 6:30pm, and we'll get started at 7:00pm.</p> <p>Description<br/>================<br/>Scala is a language that has an immense feature set, including both functional and OOP concepts. It takes a lot of thought to figure out how to best utilize the language for successful software development. We are going to delve into a little history of FP and OOP, and then analyze some scala functionality to see how we can use the language optimally. We are going to objectively look at the functional and OOP paradigms to see what combination of them makes sense to use. I guarantee you that whether you are a newcomer to programming or a seasoned developer, there will be a wealth of information (and quotes!) for you to apply to your craft.</p> <p>About Benjamin<br/>================<br/>Since I have graduated from the University of Michigan with a degree in Computer Science, I have developed in C, C++, C# and Scala, in various domains such as transportation planning, banking and gambling. I have read many books on software development, completed online courses and attended many meetup groups. I have written down everything I have learned about software development and I consistently review it to improve my craft.</p> <p>About William Hill<br/>================<br/>William Hill, The Home of Betting, is one of the world‚Äôs leading betting and gaming companies, employing more than 17,000 people worldwide. William Hill is the first British bookmaker to be licensed in Nevada and has entered the U.S. market through acquisitions of American Wagering Inc., Brandywine Bookmaking LLC and Club Cal Neva sportsbooks, giving it 100 sports betting locations across Nevada. In addition, William Hill serves as the exclusive risk manager for the State of Delaware‚Äôs Sports Lottery.</p> ",
