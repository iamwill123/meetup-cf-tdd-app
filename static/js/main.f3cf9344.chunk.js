Our technology consists of two sets of infrastructure. The first is financial contract design patterns that use economic incentives alone to ensure payout, creating a non-recourse system for financial risk transfer. The second is a decentralized data verification mechanism that adds economic guarantees to blockchain oracles.</p> <p>This workshop will teach participants how to build best-in-class financial contracts on Ethereum that can support a wide array of DeFi use cases. Using concepts borrowed from fiat financial derivatives, participants will learn\u2014with real, interactive examples\u2014how to design and create their own decentralized financial contracts that are self-enforcing, permissionless and universally accessible. The discussion will highlight common pitfalls in building financial products on blockchains, and discuss security and mechanism design concerns. Participants will learn common design patterns to write contracts that can scale to support billions of dollars of economic activity.</p> <p>If you attend this session, you can expect to:<br/>Attain a basic understanding of the #DeFi movement and core concepts behind financial derivatives.<br/>Learn why financial derivatives are different on blockchains (Discussion and demonstration of security vulnerabilities in some existing designs).<br/>Understand common exploits and attack vectors for blockchain based derivatives.<br/>Practice best practices for creating secure synthetic derivatives (Audience can deploy contracts to testnet)</p> <p>To learn more:<br/>DM and/or follow us on Twitter @UMAprotocol<br/>Follow us on Medium<br/>Sign up for early access at www.umaproject.org<br/>Read our whitepaper / check out our GitHub<br/>------------------------<br/>CURRICULUM<br/>------------------------<br/>SEE FULL CURRICULUM HERE:<br/><a ",how_to_find_us:"In Flatiron School/Access Labs 3rd floor: Please bring ID and sign in under Anthony Albertorio",visibility:"public",member_pay_fee:!1},{created:156505709e4,duration:72e5,id:"263765355",name:"Build your first RestAPI with Golang",rsvp_limit:120,date_in_series_pattern:!1,status:"upcoming",time:15664266e5,local_date:"2019-08-21",local_time:"18:30",updated:1566206527e3,utc_offset:-144e5,waitlist_count:0,yes_rsvp_count:87,venue:{id:26152482,name:"NYC Blockchain Center",lat:40.741180419921875,lon:-73.99319458007812,repinned:!0,address_1:"54 W 21st St",city:"New York",country:"us",localized_country_name:"USA",zip:"10010",state:"NY"},group:{created:1402874789e3,name:"IBM Developer New York",id:15104552,join_mode:"open",lat:40.72999954223633,lon:-73.98999786376953,urlname:"ibmcodenyc",who:"Coders",localized_location:"New York, NY",state:"NY",country:"us",region:"en_US",timezone:"US/Eastern"},link:"https://www.meetup.com/ibmcodenyc/events/263765355/",description:"<p>Golang is a language heavily used for web api building.

This time, our speaker is Benjamin Erichsen. Ben's company, William Hill, will host us and serve refreshments at their office in Exchange Place. As usual, doors will open at 6:30pm, and we'll get started at 7:00pm.</p> <p>Description<br/>================<br/>Scala is a language that has an immense feature set, including both functional and OOP concepts. It takes a lot of thought to figure out how to best utilize the language for successful software development. We are going to delve into a little history of FP and OOP, and then analyze some scala functionality to see how we can use the language optimally. We are going to objectively look at the functional and OOP paradigms to see what combination of them makes sense to use. I guarantee you that whether you are a newcomer to programming or a seasoned developer, there will be a wealth of information (and quotes!) for you to apply to your craft.</p> <p>About Benjamin<br/>================<br/>Since I have graduated from the University of Michigan with a degree in Computer Science, I have developed in C, C++, C# and Scala, in various domains such as transportation planning, banking and gambling. I have read many books on software development, completed online courses and attended many meetup groups. I have written down everything I have learned about software development and I consistently review it to improve my craft.</p> <p>About William Hill<br/>================<br/>William Hill, The Home of Betting, is one of the world\u2019s leading betting and gaming companies, employing more than 17,000 people worldwide. William Hill is the first British bookmaker to be licensed in Nevada and has entered the U.S. market through acquisitions of American Wagering Inc., Brandywine Bookmaking LLC and Club Cal Neva sportsbooks, giving it 100 sports betting locations across Nevada.
